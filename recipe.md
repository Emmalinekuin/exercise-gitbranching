Super tasty low fat, easy vegan tacos that take 5 mins to make – these are epic and a real crowd pleaser! They might take you 10-15 mins as there were 2 of us when we filmed the video but either way they are quick, tasty and incredibly delicious as well as healthy!

INGREDIENTS

Whole Wheat tortillas 300g slice into small 8-9cm circles
150 g Oyster mushrooms
1 tin of Black beans
10 Cherry tomatoes
2 tbsp tamari/ soy sauce
3 Scallions or green onions
1 clove of garlic
1 x lime
200 ml natural soy yogurt
15 g fresh coriander/ cilantro
1 Red onion
50 ml white rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
1/2 tsp black pepper
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1.5 tsp ground cumin
Chilli flakes to serve

INSTRUCTIONS

First let’s pickle the onions. This will bring out the bright pink colour and soften the raw onion taste as well as give a nice acidity to the tacos. Peel and slice the red onion into long thin slices. In a glass add the sliced onion along with the vinegar and fill the remaining space with water so that the onions are submerged and leave to sit to pickle.
Finely dice the coriander including the stalks
Slice the scallions, quarter the cherry tomatoes and finely slice the mushrooms into small bite sized pieces
Drain and rinse the black beans
Mix the soy yoghurt with half the diced coriander and the juice of 1/2 lime and mix well, this is to function like a healthier sour cream.
Heat a non stick wide bottomed pan on high heat
Add the scallions and the black beans and cherry tomatoes and pinch of salt a fry,
Slice the garlic finely and add to the pan
Fry to 2-3 mins stirring regularly
Add the spices and tamari and mix well and turn off the heat, taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.
To plate up, use a muffin tray to hold the tacos while you fill them.
Add a tbsp of the yoghurt coriander mix
A generous spoonful of the mushroom black bean mix
Top with some pickled red onion and some chopped coriander
Enjoy!
